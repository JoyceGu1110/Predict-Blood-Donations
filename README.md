**To see the final report, please click here: [Final Report](https://rpubs.com/Joyce-Gu/571493)**

## Problem 
Predict the likelihood of a donator donating again from the given data set. 

## Code Requirements 
The example code is executed in R studio (needs to be version 1.12.3 or higher)

## Dependencies 

install.packages('ggplot2')  
install.packages('corrplot')  
install.packages('car')  
install.packages('caret')  

## Description 
Use R programming to explore blood donation data and predict the likelihood of a donator donating again. 

* This process is done using a R Notebook. 
* The code should run with no errors.
* Appropriate use of data structures / packages / functions / coding practices 
* Report structure: 
    * Problem statement 
    * Dataset information 
    * Load the dataset into R studio 
    * Exploratory data analysis 
      - Missing value detection 
      - Boxplots
      - Density plots
      - Boxplots of different variables based on response variable 
    * Correlation analysis
